Unix Mentorship Platform

Welcome to Unix, a mentorship platform where students and mentors can connect, share knowledge, and help each other grow for a better future.

About the Project

This project was built as part of a web development hackathon, where I solo developed the frontend without prior knowledge of web development. I put in significant effort to create the platform, and while the backend/database is not currently implemented, I welcome any contributions from experienced developers.
